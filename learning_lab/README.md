# AI Learning Lab (Minimal)

This is your practice zone. You code here first, then move stable code into `app/ai_feature/`.

## Rule
- You write the implementation.
- Nova reviews your code and gives fixes by severity.

## Practice files
- `schemas.py`
- `api.py`
- `service.py`
- `prompts.py`
- `sql_guard.py`
- `embeddings.py`
- `semantic_search.py`
- `exercises.md`
